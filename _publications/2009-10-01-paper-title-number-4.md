excerpt: 'This study investigates how the **1927 Great Mississippi Flood** influenced the **intergenerational transmission of agricultural occupations** in the United States. Combining county-level flood exposure data with linked **1920, 1930, and 1940 U.S. decennial census microdata**, we analyze how this major environmental shock reshaped occupational choices across generations. Results indicate that children from flooded counties were **10% less likely to pursue farming** relative to peers in unaffected areas. The effect is concentrated among children from **non-farmer families**, while the occupational persistence of **farm households** remained largely stable. Within the agricultural sector, sons in flooded regions were more likely to become **paid farm workers**, reflecting a shift toward lower-risk employment, whereas sons of self-employed farmers tended to remain in **family-based farming**, demonstrating resilience in traditional agricultural practices. The findings highlight how large-scale natural disasters can simultaneously **disrupt mobility patterns** and **reinforce sectoral persistence**, revealing the complex interplay between environmental shocks and long-term economic adaptation.'
