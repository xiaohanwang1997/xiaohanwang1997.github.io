title: "Child Labor Laws and Occupational Mobility in Agriculture"
collection: research
category: manuscripts
excerpt: "This study explores the influence of **U.S. child labor legislation** on the **intergenerational transmission** of **agricultural occupations**. Utilizing data from the U.S. Decennial Census and the Census of Agriculture spanning 1870 to 1930, the analysis employs a **Difference-in-Differences** framework to uncover a notable decline in the likelihood of children from farming families pursuing agricultural careers. The findings reveal that the effects were not uniform, with variations observed across **gender**, **birth order**, and **racial groups**, where disadvantaged populations were more inclined to transition to non-agricultural industries. Furthermore, the research highlights a simultaneous **reduction in the number of farms** and an **increase in average farm size**, indicating a trend toward **sectoral consolidation**. These results underscore the role of child labor laws in shaping **occupational dynamics** and fostering a broader **structural shift away from agriculture.**"
