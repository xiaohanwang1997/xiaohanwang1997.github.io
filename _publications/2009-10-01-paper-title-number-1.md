excerpt: "This study explores the influence of **U.S. child labor legislation** on the **intergenerational transmission** of **agricultural occupations**. Drawing on data from the U.S. Decennial Census and the Census of Agriculture between 1880 and 1930, a Difference-in-Differences analysis indicates a **6.5\% reduction** in the tendency for children from agricultural families to remain in farming. Differential impacts were identified across **gender, birth order, and racial categories**, with an increased likelihood of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds moving into non-agricultural fields. The study also documents a concurrent **decrease in the quantity of farms** alongside an **expansion in their average acreage**, pointing to a consolidation within the agricultural sector. These findings demonstrate that child labor legislation was a key contributor to shifts in **occupational patterns** and hastened the economy-wide **structural move away from agriculture** in the United States."
