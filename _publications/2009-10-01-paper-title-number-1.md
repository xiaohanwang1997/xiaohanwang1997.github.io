Tuition-free college programs have reshaped higher education by influencing enrollment decisions and institutional pricing strategies. This paper evaluates the impact of the Tennessee Promise program on enrollment and tuition-related outcomes using Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) methods.

The results indicate that Tennessee Promise increased full-time first-time enrollment at two-year public institutions by at least **42%**, with particularly strong gains among **Black and Hispanic** students. In contrast, public four-year institutions experienced a **2–3%** decline in enrollment, suggesting a reallocation of students from four-year to two-year colleges.

Additionally, the **net price** at two-year institutions increased by approximately **$100–$200** per student, and **out-of-state tuition** rose by nearly **$850**, indicating institutional pricing responses to changes in student demand. Four-year institutions also reduced **institutional aid** by **$200–$300** per student, likely reflecting adjustments to shifting enrollment patterns.

These findings highlight how tuition-free college programs influence **enrollment distribution**, **financial aid strategies**, and **institutional pricing**, offering important insights for the design of future higher education policies.
