excerpt: "Tuition-free college programs have reshaped higher education by influencing enrollment decisions and institutional pricing strategies. This study examines the Tennessee Promise program’s effects on student enrollment and tuition-related outcomes. The results suggest that full-time first-time enrollment at two-year public institutions increased by at least **42%**, with particularly strong gains among **Black and Hispanic** students. In contrast, public four-year institutions experienced a **2–3%** decline in enrollment, indicating a potential reallocation of students from four-year to two-year colleges. In response to shifting student demand, **net price** at two-year institutions rose by approximately **$100–$200** per student, and **out-of-state tuition** increased by nearly **$850**. Four-year institutions also appear to have reduced **institutional aid** by **$200–$300** per student. These findings highlight how tuition-free college programs may influence **enrollment distribution**, **financial aid strategies**, and **institutional pricing**, offering insight into the broader implications of aid policy design."
