title: "The Impact of Young Workers on China’s Aggregate Labor Market"
collection: research
category: manuscripts
excerpt: "Using cross-provincial changes in **lagged birth rates** as **instrumental variables**, this study estimates the response of **unemployment** and **labor force participation rates** to exogenous changes in the **share of young workers** in China from 2002 to 2020, across different age and sex cohorts. A one percent increase in the youth share reduces the unemployment rate by **more than two percent** for both young and older workers. It also raises the labor force participation rate for all age groups — except for young workers—while holding conditions in other provinces constant. **Male workers** are more likely to follow the **cohort crowding hypothesis** than female workers. This is inconsistent with the **standard theory of unemployment**, which predicts no relationship or the opposite effect between these variables. However, the findings are consistent with a **frictional unemployment model** featuring on-the-job search, where firms are more likely to find better matches in a labor market with greater mismatch probability. Additionally, the model’s predictions regarding wage responses to birth rate shocks are supported by the Chinese data.
