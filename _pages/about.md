Hello, and welcome! Iâ€™m **Xiaohan** (pronounced *Shee-ah-hahn*), a Ph.D. candidate in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests lie in labor economics, public economics, and applied microeconometrics, with a particular focus on how policy interventions influence educational attainment and labor market outcomes.

I am passionate about using rigorous empirical methods to address real-world policy questions. My current work explores the effects of education policies and social programs on long-term economic mobility and workforce development.

**Contact:** You can reach me at xw47 [at] illinois [dot] edu.
